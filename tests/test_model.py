    stress test (docs/BENCHMARK.md's "False-Positive Stress Test",

    case above is a bare root domain or a trivial path, so none of them
    exercised the URL shapes a real login, verification, or password-reset
    flow actually produces -- which is also exactly the shape a phishing
    page is built to imitate. These cases are drawn directly from
    data/branded_path_benchmark_urls.jsonl.

    These currently FAIL against the unfixed model (as of this commit),
    by design -- CONTRIBUTING.md's guidance is to add failing regression
    tests before the fix that turns them green, so the bug is proven
    reproducible in the permanent suite rather than only in a one-off
    script. A rearchitecture PR is expected to fix these; do not weaken
    the assertions to make them pass without an actual scoring change.
